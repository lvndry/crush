# Contributing to jazz

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide explains how to set up your environment, follow the code style, write tests, and submit changes.

## Quick start

- Bun 1.x, Node.js >= 18
- Install: `bun install`
- Lint: `bun run lint`
- Build: `bun run build`
- Test: `bun test`
- Dev: `bun run dev`

## Getting started

1. Fork the repo and clone your fork
2. Create a branch from `main`:
   - Features: `feat/<topic>`
   - Fixes: `fix/<topic>`
   - Docs/Chores: `docs/<topic>` or `chore/<topic>`
3. Install dependencies: `bun install`
4. Develop using: `bun run dev`
5. Run checks locally: `bun run lint && bun run build && bun test`

## Project standards

This codebase is 100% TypeScript (strict) and uses Effect-TS.

- Prefer function declarations for top-level functions
- Use `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use discriminated unions for variants
- Always specify return types for public APIs
- Prefer `readonly` where applicable
- Validate external inputs with `@effect/schema`
- Wrap side effects in `Effect`; compose with `Effect.gen` and `pipe`
- Use `Effect.Layer` for dependency injection
- Use tagged errors via `Data.TaggedError`

Directory layout:

```
src/
  cli/
  core/
  services/
  main.ts
```

## Linting and formatting

- ESLint and Prettier are configured for TypeScript + Effect-TS best practices.
- Commands:
  - `bun run lint` — check
  - `bun run lint:fix` — fix
  - `bun run format` — format

## Build and run

- `bun run build` — typecheck + emit to `dist/`
- `bun run start` — run compiled CLI from `dist/main.js`
- `bun run dev` — watch mode for development

## Testing

- Use `bun test`
- Co-locate tests or use `__tests__` directories
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Prefer deterministic tests; mock external services with layers

Examples:

```
bun test
bun test --watch
```

## Commit messages (Conventional Commits)

Follow Conventional Commits for clear history and tooling:

- `feat(agent): add gmail tool registry`
- `fix(cli): handle unknown subcommand`
- `docs(readme): add usage examples`
- `chore(deps): bump eslint`
- `refactor(core): simplify runner`
- `test(services): cover error paths`

Reference issues when relevant, e.g. `(#123)`.

## Pull requests

Before opening a PR:

- All checks pass: `bun run lint && bun run build && bun test`
- Public APIs are typed and documented
- Update docs where needed (`README.md`, `docs/`)
- Avoid unrelated refactors; keep PRs focused and small
- Include screenshots/logs for UX/CLI changes when helpful

Target branch: `main`. Describe the problem, solution, and trade-offs.

## Continuous Integration

CI runs lint and build on pushes to `main` and on pull requests (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Keep CI green; address flakes with a clear rationale if skipping.

## Security

- Do not commit secrets; use env vars locally
- Sanitize inputs and file paths
- Use least privilege for external APIs
