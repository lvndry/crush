### Ideas not in roadmap yet

- Being able to create agents from config file `crush agent create --config agent.json`
- Right authentification info are stored and shared by all agents. But maybe we'd like to have one auth per agent. For example one agent connected to gmail account 1 and an other for gmail account 2 ?
- Might want to load the configuration from a .mjs instead of a .json
- Might want to seperate config from secrets
- MEMORY -> keep memory about my workflow preferences, favorite folders, ...

### Gmail Enhancement Ideas

- **Attachment Support** (you have the interface but not implemented)
- **createReplyToEmailTool** - Reply to specific email with thread context
- **createForwardEmailTool** - Forward email to new recipients
- **Advanced Search with Date Ranges** - Structured date filters for email search
- **Calendar Integration** (if you add Google Calendar) - Parse email for meeting details and create calendar events

### Use Cases/Workflows/Ideas I'ld like to see

- Read the diff code, create the commit message, commit and push
- Summarize my emails with `newsletter` label and then delete them
- Download an image from the internet to my destination folder
- Given a URL to a github repo, clone the repo and follow the setup instructions from the repo and setup everything for me
